# Cascade DOF – PFP Static

This Cascade DOF (Dynamic Object Framework) leverages the DOS below to implement a standard for deploying a static PFP collection to Sui:

* [dos_bucket](https://github.com/CascadeFoundation/dos_bucket) – Defines a bucket for storing Walrus blobs.
* [dos_collection](https://github.com/CascadeFoundation/dos_collection) – Defines collection-level metadata such as creator, name, description, and more.
* [dos_image](https://github.com/CascadeFoundation/dos_image) – Defines a model for an image file that's stored in a bucket.
* [dos_silo](https://github.com/CascadeFoundation/dos_silo) – Defines a warehouse object which must be filled before PFPs can be withdrawn.
